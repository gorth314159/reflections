What happens when you initialize a repository? 
Why do you need to do it?
It creates the set up files to run git.
You need to do this to start your repository.

How is the staging area different from 
the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
It works on the files that git is tracking
as well as the working directory.
It is good because some files are best not
published to git such as confidential information.
