How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see
the bug that was introduced?
If something was working before, you are able to see what was changed
and since it was working you can limit the code you need to review.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make 
you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
You can view all of the changes over time and have a point to start
off for new projects.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to 
create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically 
saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros: logically decide when to create version instead of too many
versions or too few.
Cons: you may manually create too many or too few versions causing the
same issues you were attempting to avoid.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving 
multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat 
each file separately?
Google docs are unlikely to be related. Multiple files are necessary
as they may be part of one solution.
